<main> <section class="section" id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is handled in connection with the mobile application <strong>TOLYN - The Only Light You Need</strong> (the “App”), developed and published by <strong>jellymiso, jellydevelops, and jellydevelops.com (interchangeably referred to as the "Developer")</strong>. This Policy applies only to the App on Android and does not govern third party services or advertisements displayed inside the App.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="scope"> <h2>Scope</h2> <p>This Policy describes: (1) the App’s own data practices; and (2) third‑party data practices that may occur as a result of advertisements shown inside the App. It does not apply to data collection by ad networks or other third parties, which are governed by those parties’ privacy policies.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="summary"> <h2>Quick summary</h2> <ul> <li>The App itself does not collect or store personal data.</li> <li>The App displays third‑party advertisements; those ad providers may collect and process data independently.</li> <li>The Developer does not provide a direct contact channel for privacy requests.</li> </ul> </section>

<section class="section" id="data-collected"> <h2>Data collected by the App</h2> <p><strong>None.</strong> The App does not request permissions, nor does it collect, access, or store:</p> <ul> <li>Contacts, address book, or call history</li> <li>Location (precise or approximate)</li> <li>Camera, microphone, or photos/media</li> <li>Account credentials or profile information</li> <li>Device identifiers, telemetry, analytics, or crash logs</li> <li>Payments or billing information</li> </ul> </section>

<section class="section" id="third-party-ads"> <h2>Third‑party advertising</h2> <p>The App includes third‑party advertisements served by independent ad networks. Those ad networks operate independently from the Developer and may collect and process information from your device for purposes including ad delivery, personalization, measurement, and fraud prevention. Typical data that ad networks may collect includes advertising identifiers (Android Advertising ID), IP address, device information, inferred interests, and interaction signals.</p> <p>The Developer does not control the collection or use of data by ad providers. For information about what data an ad provider collects and how to opt out, consult the ad overlay (for example, the “Why this ad?” control), the ad provider’s published privacy policy, and your device/platform privacy controls.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="data-sharing"> <h2>Data sharing and disclosures</h2> <p><strong>By the App:</strong> None — the App does not collect data to share.</p> <p><strong>By third parties:</strong> Ad networks and their partners may share data with advertisers, measurement vendors, analytics providers, and law enforcement when required by law. Any such sharing is governed by those third parties’ policies.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="retention"> <h2>Retention</h2> <p>The Developer does not retain personal data because the App does not collect personal data. Any data collected by ad networks is retained according to those providers’ retention policies; consult the ad network’s documentation for details.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="user-rights"> <h2>User rights and choices</h2> <p>Because the Developer does not collect personal data via the App, the Developer cannot provide copies, corrections, or deletion of developer‑held data. To exercise rights over data collected by ad networks or other third parties, use the privacy controls offered by those providers and platform settings.</p> <ul> <li>Android Advertising ID: Reset or opt out of ad personalization in your device settings.</li> <li>Ad overlay controls: Use “Why this ad?” or similar in the ad UI to access provider opt‑out options.</li> <li>Platform privacy: Adjust Google/Android privacy and ad personalization settings on your device.</li> </ul> </section>

<section class="section" id="children"> <h2>Children</h2> <p>The App is not directed to children below the applicable minimum age. The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe an ad shown in the App collected data from a child, contact the ad provider directly using the contact or opt‑out links available in the ad overlay.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="security"> <h2>Security</h2> <p>The App contains no developer‑held personal data. The Developer follows standard secure development practices to reduce risks in the App binary and in ad integration. Users should maintain device security and platform updates to reduce risk.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="international-transfers"> <h2>International transfers</h2> <p>The Developer does not transfer personal data because the App does not collect personal data. Ad networks and other third parties may transfer data across borders; consult those providers’ privacy policies for information about transfer mechanisms and safeguards.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="changes"> <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2> <p>This Policy may be updated periodically. The current version and effective date will be posted at <a href="https://jellydevelops.com">https://jellydevelops.com</a>. Continued use of the App after a change indicates acceptance of the updated Policy.</p> <div class="note">If App functionality changes (for example, new permissions, analytics, sign‑in, payments, or data collection are added), the Developer will update this Policy and the app store listing prior to releasing the changed App.</div> </section>

<section class="section" id="contact"> <h2>Contact</h2> <p>The Developer does not provide a direct contact channel for privacy requests. For concerns about data collected by advertisements shown in the App, use the ad overlay controls or the ad provider’s published privacy resources, and use your device/platform privacy settings (Android) to limit ad personalization.</p> </section>

<section class="section" id="store-listing"> <h2>Suggested store listing statements</h2> <p><strong>Short store listing:</strong> “TOLYN does not collect personal data; third‑party ads shown in the app may collect data under their own policies.”</p> <p><strong>Play Store data safety suggestion:</strong> “No developer‑collected data. Third‑party ad network data collection may occur; see ad provider policies.”</p> </section> </main>
